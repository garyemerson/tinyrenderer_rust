Lesson 1
--------
if going from x0 to x1 and using time interval t of 0 -> 1 then x values will be:
    
    x0 + (x1 - x0)*t <=>
    x0 + x1*t + x0*t <=>
    x0 - x0*t + x1*t <=>
    x0*(1 - t) + x1*t

same for going from y0 to y1

Lesson 2
--------
Barycentric coord of a point given a triangle can be thought of as the weights to corresponding vertices on the triangle. The weights need to add to 1. The closer you are to a point, the higher it's weight. A weight can only be negative if the point lies outside the triangle.
